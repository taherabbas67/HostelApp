# HostelApp
<h2>A Mobile Application</h2>

<h3>Abstract :</h3>
The hostel management application is used by the residents or students of the hostel to report or complain about the issues in their hostel room. The Residence managers can receive complaints about the issues and take action to resolve them.

<h3>Introduction :</h3>
In many Hostels and pay residences, the residents will face different problems, like water leakage and problems related to lights, fans, air-conditioners, etc. Residents try to report them, but many hostels donâ€™t have a proper option to report them. They just have to tell and remind the warden. Some hostels maintain a book where residents can write about the problems, but in many cases, no warden gets back to the logbook to solve the issues. So here we need a dedicated system where residents can report complaints and get updates like estimated time and issues resolved. In the dedicated system, residence managers or wardens can receive complaints, systematically resolve the issues, and update the resident. Residence management can look over the issues received and issues resolved so that they can push their staff to work more efficiently.


<h3>Problem Statement :</h3>
Many Hostel Management applications are available, but they need to solve the major  problem in hostels: issues faced by the residents. All the hostel management applications are mainly focused on managing the admissions and the food of the hostel. The feature where residents can report or complain about their problems should be incubated into the applications.
